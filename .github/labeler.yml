    Thanks for the contribution!
    I have applied any labels matching special text in your title and description.

    Please review the labels and make any necessary changes.

# Labels is an object where:
# - keys are labels
# - values are objects of { include: [ pattern ], exclude: [ pattern ] }
#    - pattern must be a valid regex, and is applied globally to
#      title + description of issues and/or prs (see enabled config above)
#    - 'include' patterns will associate a label if any of these patterns match
#    - 'exclude' patterns will ignore this label if any of these patterns match
labels:
  'kind/CLEANUP':
    include:
      - '(chore|cleanup):'
    exclude: []
  'kind/BUGFIX':
    include:
      - '(fix|bugfix):'
    exclude: []
  'kind/ENHANCEMENT':
    include:
      - 'enhancement:'
    exclude: []
